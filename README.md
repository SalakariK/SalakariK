- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SalakariK
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in motorcycling, coding and life
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything of computer technology


I work as a lecturer at a vocational school in Pori. I teach installation and maintenance of linux and unix workstations, both in physical and virtual environments, e.g. Oracle VirtualBox and ProxMox. I also teach internet technology programming, i.e. full stack coding.

I test everything first and then give instructions to the students. When the students do tasks according to the instructions, I go to help and advise them.

My motto is "learning by doing"
